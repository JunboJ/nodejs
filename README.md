# nodejs

Trying to learn more about nodejs by go through a online course


NOTE:

Node.js is another "version" of javescript that built on chrome V8 engin and rather than running on browser, it can be ran on any machine. Thus, node.js can be used as server side language. 

Comparing with javascript, node.js has access to file system, ability to connect to various types of databases and ability to handle requests and send back response. 

Node.js can also be used as programming language for building any utilities like java and c++. So, unlike PHP which need other tools such apache to build server. Node.js can build web server itself.
